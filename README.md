# Next.js TIL (Today I Learn)

Welcome to my Next.js TIL (Today I Learn) repository! This repository is a collection of small yet powerful components, hooks, and utilities that I implement as I explore the possibilities of Next.js. Each addition here is aimed at solving common challenges in web development while leveraging the full potential of Next.js.

## üìö Overview

This project is part of my TIL series, where I document and share my daily learning experiences. The purpose is to create a public repository that not only reinforces my knowledge but also acts as a useful resource for other developers.

## üöÄ Implemented Features

Below is a list of the functionalities I‚Äôve implemented so far. These features are designed to be modular, reusable, and easy to integrate into any Next.js project.

1. **Form Validation with Zod:** A robust form validation function using Zod, providing strong typing and validation in one step for complex forms.

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Additions
I‚Äôm always learning and exploring new things in Next.js. Here are some features I plan to implement soon:

1. **Client-Side Pagination:** A function that paginates items on the client side, helping to break down large datasets into manageable pages for better performance and user experience.
2. **Debounce Input Handler:** A debounce function that reduces the frequency of API calls or expensive operations triggered by user input, improving the performance of forms and search features.
3. **Cookie Consent Banner:** A simple banner component that asks users for their consent to use cookies, storing their choice in localStorage for compliance with privacy laws.
4. **Lazy Loading Images:** A utility function that defers the loading of images until they are about to enter the viewport, enhancing page load times and user experience.
5. **Scroll to Top Button:** A button that appears when the user scrolls down the page, allowing them to easily return to the top with a single click.
6. **Dynamic Meta Tags:** A function to dynamically set and update meta tags on different pages, useful for improving SEO in a Next.js application.
7. **Custom Hook for Fetching Data:** A reusable hook that simplifies the process of fetching data from an API, including handling loading states and errors.
8. **Toggle Dark Mode:** A feature that allows users to switch between light and dark themes, with their preference saved in localStorage for future visits.
9. **Infinite Scroll:** A function that automatically loads more content as the user scrolls down the page, eliminating the need for pagination links.

Feel free to use, modify, or contribute to this repository. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
